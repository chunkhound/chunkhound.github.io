Transform AI coding assistants from guessing to knowing. ChunkHound enables deep, iterative exploration that understands your complete engineering context - code, architecture, patterns, and written knowledge.

## The Reality

Your AI assistant helps you code but lacks critical context:
**Missing code context** • **Duplicate functions** • **Breaking patterns** • **Lost architecture** • **Conflicting specs** • **Scale overwhelm**

**ChunkHound gives AI the context it needs** - deep understanding of your code, files, and architectural decisions before writing anything.

## What is Deep Research for Code & Files?

Just like Deep Research transforms how you explore the web, ChunkHound and the [Code Expert](/code-expert-agent) brings Deep Research to your local codebase and files. **Search across 22+ file types** including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Markdown, PDFs, and more.

- **Iterative Discovery** - Start with a concept, expand through code, markdown files, and comments
- **Multi-hop Search** - Find connections between implementation and written knowledge
- **Architecture Map** - Understand relationships across code files, README files, and design notes
- **Complete Context** - Find that `validateEmail()` AND the markdown file explaining why it exists

## Production Ready

**Battle-tested at scale:**
- Handles codebases from thousands to **millions of lines**
- **22** programming languages with full parsing support
- **5 minutes** from installation to first search
- **Zero** cloud dependencies - runs entirely local

Built on proven foundations:<br />
[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for parsing • [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) for local storage • [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for AI integration

**Stop recreating code. Start with deep understanding.**
