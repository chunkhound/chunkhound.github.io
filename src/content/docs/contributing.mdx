Welcome to ChunkHound's 100% AI-generated codebase! We're building the future of AI-assisted development by maintaining production-quality software that's entirely generated by AI agents with human guidance. Every line of code, documentation, and feature comes from AI - proving that AI-generated code can be robust, maintainable, and continuously evolving.

Read our [origin story](/origin-story/) to see how ChunkHound bootstrapped itself from empty repository to functional codebase in a single day.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, you need ChunkHound set up and running:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Install & Configure ChunkHound" icon="rocket">
    Follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart/) to install ChunkHound, configure your embedding provider, index your first codebase, and set up MCP integration
  </Card>

  <Card title="Set Up Code Expert Agent" icon="approve-check">
    Install the [Code Expert Agent](/code-expert-agent/) - essential for understanding the codebase before coding
  </Card>

  <Card title="Set Up Research Tools" icon="magnifier">
    You'll need additional MCP tools for web searches and documentation access. For a custom research agent designed for coding workflows, ping `@ofri` in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAepHEXXnX)

## Development Workflow

### Before Writing Any Code

**Always use the Code Expert Agent first.** This is crucial for maintaining code quality in an AI-generated codebase:

```
Use the code expert. Consider the surrounding code style, architecture, and module responsibilities.
Think of the minimal required changes that reuse as much as possible.
```

The Code Expert Agent ensures your AI agent:
- Understands existing patterns and conventions
- Reuses existing mechanisms instead of duplicating code
- Follows the established architecture
- Makes minimal, targeted changes

### Quality Standards

1. **AI-generated only** - All code must be generated by AI agents
2. **Match existing patterns** - Study how similar features are implemented
3. **Minimize changes** - Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
4. **Reuse mechanisms** - Don't reinvent existing functionality
5. **Optimize for simplicity** - Follow KISS principle while balancing developer experience and scalability needs for ChunkHound's enterprise use cases
6. **Test thoroughly** - Always run smoke tests before commits:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v
   ```

### Testing Philosophy

ChunkHound's testing approach is designed for AI-generated development:

- **Smoke tests are mandatory** - Run before every commit to catch AI-introduced breaking changes
- **Real components over mocks** - Exercise actual functionality whenever possible
- **Tests as AI guardrails** - Define expected behavior to guide AI agents
- **Fast feedback over coverage** - Better fewer reliable tests than many flaky ones

<Aside type="tip" title="Testing Tip">
Smoke tests catch import-time crashes and type annotation bugs in ~10 seconds - essential for AI-generated code safety.

## Claude Code Commands

These optimized slash commands help maintain ChunkHound's code quality. Create these files in your project's `.claude/commands/` directory:

### Code Review Command

Create `.claude/commands/review.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Critical code review before committing changes
argument-hint: [description of changes]
---

You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze the current changeset and provide a critical review.

The changes in the working tree were meant to: $ARGUMENTS

Think step-by-step through each aspect below, focusing solely on the changes in the working tree.

1. **Architecture & Design**
   - Verify conformance to project architecture
   - Check module responsibilities are respected
   - Ensure changes align with the original intent

2. **Code Quality**
   - Code must be self-explanatory and readable
   - Style must match surrounding code patterns
   - Changes must be minimal - nothing unneeded
   - Follow KISS principle

3. **Maintainability**
   - Optimize for future LLM agents working on the codebase
   - Ensure intent is clear and unambiguous
   - Verify comments and docs remain in sync with code

4. **User Experience**
   - Identify areas where extra effort would significantly improve UX
   - Balance simplicity with meaningful enhancements

Review the changes critically. Focus on issues that matter.
DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING - only review.
```

### Commit Command

Create `.claude/commands/commit.md`:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*), Bash(git diff:*)
argument-hint: [description of changes]
description: Review changes and create clean git commits
---
$ARGUMENTS
---
Review the changes and create atomic commits based on the intended behavior above.

PROCESS:
1. Review all diffs since last commit
2. Identify logical units - split unrelated changes into separate commits
3. Use partial/hunk staging when files contain multiple logical changes
4. Write single-line commit messages describing WHAT changed

CONSTRAINTS:
- Exclude temporary/non-essential files
- Update .gitignore only if necessary
- Commit locally only (no push)
- Keep commit messages clear and concise - one line each

Execute the commits now.
```

### Using the Commands

**Recommended Workflow:**

1. Make your changes
2. Review: `/project:review "add new language parser support"`
3. **Think critically** about the suggestions - don't blindly accept them
4. Apply only the improvements that make sense
5. Commit: `/project:commit "fix embedding batch size calculation"`

The review command provides suggestions, not requirements. Use your judgment to determine which suggestions improve the code and which don't fit the context.
